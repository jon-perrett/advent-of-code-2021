# advent-of-code-2021

Advent of code 2021 - new language each day.

The challenge is to complete Advent of Code, but using a different language each day.

## Schedule
Below is the languages I will use for each of the days. It is ordered very roughly in reverse order of my familiarity with the languages (with a few exceptions), so that the harder challenges towards the end of the month are done in languages I'm more familiar with. Hopefully...

## Tasting Notes
This section contains a description of my thoughts on each language, written as I do each challenge.  
Please note that I probably won't do much research into specific features of each language, so some of the solutions may be horrific to someone familiar in the language!  
### 1st December - Rust
Experience level: _I'd probably recognise it if I saw it_  
Thoughts going into it: I've seen the syntax before and I can't say I was a fan... let's see how it goes.  
Thoughts after completing: 
- It's quite annoying how there appears to be a lot of built in functionality, but to me it isn't intuitive as to what you can and can't do with different types.  
- The compiler has useful error messages.
- I feel like I absolutely abused this language, it definitely has more features and I'd probably like to try it out properly. Maybe even 'learn it properly'...  
Sorry Rust... 
### 2nd December - C
Experience level: _a bit..._  
Thoughts going into it: I should be able to do this, at least it's a sensible language  
Thoughts after completing:  
- To be honest it's hard.
- I got a correct solution for puzzle 1, started working on puzzle 2 and realised my solution to answer 1 was flaky. I did fix this in the end.
- Pointers are useful actually.
### 3rd December - Ruby
Experience level: _none_  
Thoughts going into it: I don't really know what to expect.  
Thoughts after completing:
- It feels a bit like Python, with array methods that remind me of javascript.  
- Got caught out with division being integer division.  
- I don't know what I'd use this language for in reality, but it isn't awful.
